# Heuristic-Planning
-This is a project consiting of Any angle Path planning algorithms :
1.Theta*\
2. 2^k A* with k=2,3,4,5,6 for 8,16,32  and 64 neighbourhoods heuristics\
-Code is excecuted in Google Colaboratory\
-Data is taken from : MovingAI .(Link to the page : https://movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html)\
-Download the necessary packages and run colab notebooks corresponding to Theta* and 2^kA* with different k\
-The "all_tasks.pickle" contains 2 maps and 100 random tasks for each map are used to run and test the algorithms\

*This project was done by : Eugenia Mitrokhina and Ilda Alushaj*
